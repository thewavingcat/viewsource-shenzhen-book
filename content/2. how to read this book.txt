# How to read this book

This document is a mix of documentation, advocacy, and guide book. 

In your internet browser, if you "view source" you get to look under the hood of the website you're visiting. This helps you understand how everything works, or why it doesn't. We see this document in that same tradition, hence the name *View Source: Shenzhen*.

In this document we share some of our experiences from Shenzhen, our positions, and some very hands-on pointers that might just make your life in Shenzhen so much easier. (You'll find a collection of useful hints to prepare your visit in the chapter *Preparing for your trip*.)

For our first trip we made a point of keeping an extra open mind. We tried to cultivate a certain naivety in order not to bring in too many presumptions. In some cases we also simply got things wrong, and we share those, too wherever they seem relevant and useful. Simultaneously, we worked closely with local partners—especially our host David Li of the Shenzhen Open Innovation lab—without whom we would have not gotten anywhere as deeply into this ecosystem. We have him and his team and partners to thank not just for kindly hosting us but also for sharing their time, contacts, and knowledge with us openly and more than graciously.

By doing our first whirlwind trip and working with our local Shenzhen partners we developed a much better understanding on what works and what doesn't, the what, how and why. This allowed us to do a second trip, this time opening up seats for 20 participants to join in, and provide them with a similar experience. 

On both trips, part of The Incredible Machine had a side quest: To prototype Velocracy, a smart bike lock to serve as the backbone of a decentralized, open-source bike sharing network that is fair for everyone, based on blockchain technology and open source hardware.

**Velocracy in a nutshell:** Velocracy is a decentralized, open-source bike sharing network built with fair pricing, privacy, and transparency in mind, and designed to stimulate the growth its bike network. As Marcel Schouwenaar describes the project in an interview: 

> "Velocracy is a system of open-source city bikes expanding itself through use and rental. Every bike has a lock that opens when you check in with your smartphone. You use the bike and pay automatically with a bitcoin-like payment system as soon as you close the lock. The lock  saves the payments until the bicycle has earned enough money. They cash the money in order to add a new bike to the network. This way, the system spreads through the city like a virus."

---

Team Velocracy's mission wasn't an easy one as the project has some highly unusual characteristics. This connected bike lock would be as open-source as possible, it would be part of a fully decentralized and—as far as possible—"ownerless" structure, and secured by blockchain technology. 

Any one of these characteristics would make for a challenge; taken together they would really put the skills and imagination of our Shenzhen partners to the test. Having a concrete project to talk about also helped us have the kind of conversations with design houses and manufacturers that go beyond mere interviews. We got to experience the real process, the type of reaction and feedback you'd get with a project in an early stage of development, that might seem outlandish at first, and that poses complex challenges.

This document aims to be a condensed version of our experiences and provide a first go-to reference for your own Shenzhen experience. You'll find some structural information and overall background, some names and organizations to look up, as well as some very concrete guide-book style pointers.

If you find anything missing or erroneous, please let us know. We love to hear from you.
