## Building a movement for responsible IoT

It seems essential to nurture a broad alliance—a movement, really—that advocates responsible IoT in all its many facets.

We see our research trips to Shenzhen, this publication, the broad range of activities under the ThingsCon and Just Things umbrellas, all as contributing to this larger vision of a resonsible, ethical, human-centered Internet of Things. An IoT that works for everyone, long term and sustainably, and that improves society rather by creating (as opposed to extracting) value.

We jokingly referred to our merry band on these trips as the #RIoT Alliance—the Responsible Internet of Things Alliance. It's not a fixed group, or even an official one. We believe that any organization should be free to choose to self-identify as "values-aligned" and support this overall agenda for a responsible IoT. 

We're all in this together.
