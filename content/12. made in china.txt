## "Made in China"

China is trying to shed the image that had for decades been associated with the *Made in China* label.

In her 2010 book *Brand New China: Advertising, Media, and Commercial Culture*, Professor of Chinese media and Cultural Studies at MIT Jing Wang ([p.135-36](https://books.google.de/books?hl=en&lr=&id=qTm_RVqrGRwC&oi=fnd&pg=PR7&dq=Brand+New+China:+Advertising,+Media,+and+Commercial+Culture&ots=T_-k5EjgYm&sig=3QDTFE60QoLj9C7VmgEJ8ybOVr0#v=onepage&q=Brand%20New%20China%3A%20Advertising%2C%20Media%2C%20and%20Commercial%20Culture&f=false)) explains how there's a major rebranding effort going on, and has been for a while. She specifically mentions advertising agency Saatchi & Saatchi's efforts starting around 2000 to make *Made in China* a premium global brand.

Wang elaborates (p.136): "No one disagrees that China is the 'perpetual market of tomorrow' and the world's largest selling and buying country, but as a brand, the country's name is a negative factor for many and anathema for some."

So the idea was that if *Made in Japan* had been able to shed its earlier "cheap and chunky" image, so could China shed it's negative image for cheap, low-quality manufacturing too.

David Li first pointed me to the history of the label *Made in Germany*. It's a fascinating history ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Made_in_Germany)): “The label was originally introduced in Britain [in 1887] to mark foreign produce more obviously, as foreign manufactures had been falsely marking inferior goods with the marks of renowned British manufacturing companies and importing them into the United Kingdom. Most of these were found to be originating from Germany…” 

In other words, *Made in Germany* was a consumer protection measure, a warning against inferior goods imported from Germany.  That was a long time ago, and the image associated with that label has changed profoundly.

How wrong and outdated might our current conception of the quality of “Made in China” be? From what we’ve seen so far in Shenzhen, there is a lot of high-quality design work done locally. We know that the manufacturing can be done here in all levels of quality. After all, cheap USB cables are made in Shenzhen alongside premium products like iPhones.

Purely anecdotally, when we tried out an immersive VR simulation inside a Huaqiangbei showroom for high-end technology, we experienced that all that glitters is not gold, even in high-end showrooms. The VR experience consisted of a suspension bridge flanked by two green walls. Equipped with headphones and VR headset you'd cross the physical suspension bridge; within the simulation there would be a dramatic setting of a suspension bridge breaking, with lots of rocks and fire all around flying through the air, maybe from a volcano eruption. 
Once I was two thirds across the bridge I crashed through it. I was confused for a split second: Had this been such an intense simulation that my mind successfully tricked me into this experience? It hadn't: One of the wooden planks of the bridge hadn't been fastened and I had fallen through the actual, physical bridge.

Half laughing, half in shock I stood their and watched the attendant quickly take a look at the situation and then retreat. I got away with a bit of a shock, a slightly bloody shin, and a good story to tell. This, too, is *Made in China*—and a good reminder that quality control is up to the buyer.

Certainly the government is very aware of its image, and of the impact soft powers like image and branding can have. That's presumably part of why filming in Huaqiangbei market is restricted—to limit the visibility of knock-offs and other *Shanzhai* products. It's one step on the way to cleaning up the image of *Made in China*.

What is “Made in China” going to mean in 5, 10, 50 years?
